The dataset comes in four versions:

- rsdata3xx.RData with the categorical variables coded as numeric
- rsdata3xx.RData with the categorical variables as factors
- rsdata3xx.txt with the categorical variables coded as numeric
- rsdata3xx.txt with the categorical variables as strings

If you prefer the dataset containing numeric variables the corresponding labels to the numeric values can be found here: https://github.com/KIHeartFailure/shfdb3dm/blob/master/metadata/meta_factorlevels.xlsx

The name of the dataset will be rsdata3xx, depending on version number (see [Versions](www.shfdb3/versions/)). 

The variable description (labels, units, information on when the variable is valid, etc.) can be found here: https://github.com/KIHeartFailure/shfdb3dm/blob/master/metadata/meta_variables.xlsx.
