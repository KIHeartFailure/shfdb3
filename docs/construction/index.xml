        <description>The Swedish Heart Failure Registry (SwedeHF) The Swedish Heart Failure Registry (SwedeHF) (Swedish: RiksSvikt) is managed by Uppsala Clinical Research Center (UCR).
SwedeHF is a health quality and research registry that started in 2000 and became nationwide 2003. Coverage is ~18% of all incident in- or out-patient HF encounters by cardiology or internal medicine in Sweden, but higher for prevelant cases. Coverage is lower in primary care but few patients are seen exclusively in primary care and are therefore caught and registered in cardiology or internal medicine.</description>

        <description>For each post in SwedeHF a set of controls was chosen by Statistics Sweden in a ratio of 5:1. Since a person can have more than one registered post in SwedeHF a patient can have more than 5 controls in total, up to 5 for each posts.
Eligible controls were persons without re-used and changed Swedish personal identity numbers (PINs) and free of HF, defined either in the National Patient registry (ICD-10: I110, I130, I132, I255, I420, I423, 1425-9, I43, I50, J81, K761, R57, ICD-9: 414W, 425E-H, 425W, 425X, 428) or SwedeHF, at the end of the year of the index date for the case and matched by gender, year of birth and county of residence at index.</description>
