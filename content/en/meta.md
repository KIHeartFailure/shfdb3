The dataset comes in 6 versions:

- rsdata3xx.RData with the categorical variables coded as numeric
- rsdata3xx.RData with the categorical variables as factors
- rsdata3xx.txt (tab-separated) with the categorical variables coded as numeric
- rsdata3xx.txt (tab-separated) with the categorical variables as strings
- rsdata3xx.dta (Stata v 13) with the categorical variables coded as numeric
- rsdata3xx.dta (Stata v 13) with the categorical variables as strings

Note that the .dta versions are experimental so check number of observations/patients and descriptive statistics carefully against website. 

If you prefer the dataset containing numeric variables the corresponding labels to the numeric values can be found here: https://github.com/KIHeartFailure/shfdb3dm/blob/master/metadata/meta_factorlevels.xlsx

The name of the dataset will be rsdata3xx, depending on version number (see [Versions](www.shfdb3/versions/)). 

The variable description (labels, units, information on when the variable is valid, etc.) can be found here: https://github.com/KIHeartFailure/shfdb3dm/blob/master/metadata/meta_variables.xlsx.
